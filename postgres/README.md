# Postgres

## Introduction

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is a widely used open-source database management system. Utilized either as a standalone database, or as a component of larger systems, Postgres can be used to manage anything from simple application logs to massive datasets.

In this example, we demonstrate how one can effectively and efficiently tune Postgres resources by utilizing [pgbench](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/pgbench.html), a customizable load tester for Postgres.

## Prerequisites

You must have a Kubernetes cluster. While this example will run on Minikube, we highly recommend using a cluster with 2 nodes, 8vCPUs (4 on each node) and 16GB of memory (8 on each node). Additionally, you will need a local configured copy of `kubectl`.

You will also need to initialize StormForge Optimize in your cluster, you can follow the instructions from the [installation guide](https://docs.stormforge.io/getting-started/install/).

## Example Resources

The resources for this tutorial can be found in the [`/postgres`](https://github.com/thestormforge/examples/tree/master/postgres) directory of the `examples` source repository. The following manifests define how to run Postgres:

* `application.yaml`
  : The StormForge Optimize description of the application.
* `postgres.yaml`
  : The resources for the Postgres application itself.

The application includes a configuration secret which allows you to control the load to your database:
* `PGBENCH_SCALE` Set this value to multiply the number of rows generated by the scale factor (for a scale of 1, pgbench will create 100,000 rows).
* `PGBENCH_CLIENTS`	Set this value to the number of clients to use for the benchmark.
* `PGBENCH_TRANSACTIONS` Set this value to configure the number of transactions each client runs.
* `PGBENCH_JOBS` Set this value to the number of worker threads to be used by pgbench.

More information can be found on the [pgbench](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/pgbench.html) and [crunchydata](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/crunchy-postgres-containers/2.4.1/container-specifications/crunchy-pgbench/) documentation.

The description of the application in `application.yaml` is used to determine how to apply load to the application (in this case, using pgbench as a custom load test), and what the objective of the optimization is (reducing cost and the time required to execute the benchmark). Feel free to change the name or namespace to avoid conflicting with other experiments in the cluster.

To launch the experiment run `kubectl apply -f postgres.yaml -f <(stormforge generate experiment -f application.yaml)`

## Experiment Lifecycle

For every trial, two pods will come up:
1. A `postgres` pod that contains the database that trial will run against and get patched accordingly
2. An `<experiment-name>` pod which runs `pgbench` against the database - this is the actual trial pod

For more information on running, monitoring and maintaining experiments, please refer to our [quickstart](https://docs.stormforge.io/getting-started/quickstart/) and [experiment lifecycle](https://docs.stormforge.io/lifecycle/) documentation.
