# Web App Example

## Running The Experiment
From `examples/voting-webapp` execute

`kubectl apply -k .`

## Introduction
A simple distributed application based on the official Docker [voting app](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app).
This application allows users to vote on "cats" vs. "dogs", and serves the results in a simple web page.

From the Docker example-voting-app documentation:
The application architecture is made of 5 components (see diagram below):
* A front-end web app in [Python](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app/tree/master/vote) or [ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app/tree/master/vote/dotnet) which lets you vote between two options
* A [Redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/) or [NATS](https://hub.docker.com/_/nats/) queue which collects new votes
* A [.NET Core](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app/tree/master/worker/src/Worker), [Java](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app/tree/master/worker/src/main/java/worker) or [.NET Core 2.1](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app/tree/master/worker/dotnet) worker which consumes votes and stores them inâ€¦
* A [Postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) or [TiDB](https://hub.docker.com/r/dockersamples/tidb/tags/) database backed by a Docker volume
* A [Node.js](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app/tree/master/result) or [ASP.NET Core SignalR](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app/tree/master/result/dotnet) webapp which shows the results of the voting in real time

In this example, we demonstrate how to tune a typical application with several components, using [Locust](https://locust.io/). Locust makes repeated HTTP calls to the voting service, thereby simulating user load on the application.

## Prerequisites

You must have a Kubernetes cluster. We recommend using a cluster with 4 nodes, 16 vCPUs (4 on each node) and 32GB of memory (8 on each node). Additionally, you will need a local configured copy of `kubectl`.

Additionally, you will need a local configured copy of `kubectl` and to initialize StormForge Optimize in your cluster. You can download a binary for your platform from the [installation guide](https://docs.stormforge.io/getting-started/install/) and run `stormforge init` (while connected to your cluster).

## Example Resources

The resources in this directory aren't going to launch experiments in StormForge Optimize in and off themselves. For that, see [locust-metrics](../webserver/locust-metrics). Nevertheless, here is a short description for each of them.

`application/kustomization.yaml`
: The input to Kustomize used to build the Kubernetes object manifests for this example. Change "experiment.yaml" to "experiment_free_tier.yaml" if you are using our free tier plan.

`application/postgres.yaml`
: The manifest for the PostgreSQL database.

`applicaton/redis.yaml`
: The manifest for the Redis queue.

`application/results-exporter.yaml`
: The manifest for the results exporter.

`applicaton/results-service.yaml`
: The manifest for the results service.

`application/voting-service.yaml`
: The manifest for the voting service.

`application/worker.yaml`
: The manifest for the .NET worker.

`results-exporter/`
: This directory contains files required to run the results exporter. The exporter's role is to expose the throughput metric over HTTP (in contrast to the original websocket implementation in the results service) so that it can be collected by the jsonpath metric collector.
`app.py` contains the exporter application, `requirements.txt` are the python library requirements and `Dockerfile` contains the Docker commands to run the exporter container. There is no need to build the image; the folder is only included for reference.

More information can be found on the [docker example voting app](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app) and [Locust](https://docs.locust.io/en/stable/) docs.
