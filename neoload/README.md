# Voting Webapp optimized using Tricentis Neoload Web Load Testing

## Overview

The goal of this example is to optimize the [voting webapp](https://github.com/thestormforge/examples/tree/master/voting-webapp) using [Tricentis Neoload](https://neoload.saas.neotys.com/) as load test tool. 

In this experiment, the load test is performed by the SaaS version of [Tricentis Neoload](https://neoload.saas.neotys.com/). This allows us to better simulate real-life traffic load on the application.

## Prerequisites

You must have a Kubernetes cluster. We recommend using a cluster with 4 nodes, 16 vCPUs (4 on each node) and 32GB of memory (8 on each node). Additionally, you will need a local configured copy of `kubectl`.

Additionally, you will need a local configured copy of `kubectl` and to initialize StormForge Optimize in your cluster. You can download a binary for your platform from the [installation guide](https://docs.stormforge.io/optimize/getting-started/install/) and run `stormforge init` (while connected to your cluster).

To use the run-experiment.sh script, you also need the uuidgen package pre-installed. 

## Run the experiment
### Deploy the voting webapp with ingress

Because the load test resides outside of the cluster, the voting webapp needs to be exposed with a publicly accessible IP address.

Run:
`kubectl apply -f application.yaml  `

### Set Neoload authentication token
The Neoload authentication token is defined as a kubernetes Secret neoload-token in experiment.yaml.  You need to update it with your own token issued by Tricentis. 

### Launch an experiment
The run-experiment.sh script fully automates the experiment. You will need to set your kubernetes context for the namespace you are working in with the voting-webapp. You will then need to specify the number of trials you would like to run when prompted. The default is 20. 

Run:
`./run-experiment.sh`

### Monitor the experiment progress and results

The best way to monitor the experiment progress is to use the [web based dashboard](https://app.stormforge.io/)

You can also access the status of the trials using the `kubectl` command line tool.

```
‚ùØ kubectl get trials

```

## Technical Process
The experiment is fully automated as defined in the experiment.yaml 

In the experiment spec, you can see the parameters we are using for our experiment. 

```
spec:
  optimization:
  - name: "experimentBudget"
    value: "BUDGET"  
  parameters:
  - name: deployment/db/db/resources/cpu
    baseline: 1000
    min: 500
    max: 2000
  - name: deployment/db/db/resources/memory
    baseline: 2000
    min: 1000
    max: 4000
  - name: deployment/redis/redis/resources/cpu
    baseline: 1000
    min: 500
    max: 2000
  - name: deployment/redis/redis/resources/memory
    baseline: 2000
    min: 1000
    max: 4000
  - name: deployment/result-service/result-service/resources/cpu
    baseline: 1000
    min: 500
    max: 2000
  - name: deployment/result-service/result-service/resources/memory
    baseline: 2000
    min: 1000
    max: 4000
  - name: deployment/voting-service/voting-service/resources/cpu
    baseline: 1000
    min: 500
    max: 2000
  - name: deployment/voting-service/voting-service/resources/memory
    baseline: 2000
    min: 1000
    max: 4000
  - name: deployment/worker/worker/resources/cpu
    baseline: 1000
    min: 500
    max: 2000
  - name: deployment/worker/worker/resources/memory
    baseline: 2000
    min: 1000
    max: 4000
```



Next, we need to define the metrics or objectives we are optimizing for. 

```
  metrics:
  - name: p95-latency
    type: prometheus
    minimize: true
    query: scalar(p95{job="trialRun",instance="{{ .Trial.Name }}"})
  - name: p99-latency
    type: prometheus
    minimize: true
    query: scalar(p99{job="trialRun",instance="{{ .Trial.Name }}"})
  - name: cost
    type: prometheus
    minimize: true
    query: ({{ cpuRequests . "" }} * 17) + ({{ memoryRequests . "" | GB }} * 3)
  - name: cost-cpu-requests
    type: prometheus
    minimize: true
    optimize: false
    query: '{{ cpuRequests . "" }}'
  - name: cost-memory-requests
    type: prometheus
    minimize: true
    optimize: false
    query: '{{ memoryRequests . "" | GB }}'
 
```

Please note that the cost is calculated based on the CPU and Memory consumed in that trial.

Finally, we define our patches and our trial template.

```

```

You can see here how we are patching the voting-service deployment for CPU and memory allocation. You can also see here that we use the custom neoload-trials container image for load generation. We can validate our trial patch by describing a voting-service pod and verifying the trial settings by describing the trial
