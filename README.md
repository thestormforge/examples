## Contributing

You are invited to contribute to new features, fixes, or updates, large or
small; we are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to
process them as fast as we can.

Before you start to code, we recommend discussing your plans through a [GitHub
issue][issues], especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other
contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give you feedback on
your design, and help you find out if someone else is working on the same thing.
