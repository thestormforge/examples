# Locust Metrics Example

This example shows how to optimize the voting app using:
- the experiment generator
- the metrics built into Locust

This is useful when tuning an application that does not have metrics yet.

## Deploy the voting app

Run
```
kustomize build . | kubectl apply -f -
```
## Create an experiment

The `app.yaml` file defines the experiment to be generated. In this experiment we use Locust for the load test

```
scenarios:
- name: 100-clients
  locust:
    users: 400
    spawnRate: 20
    locustfile: locustfile.py
```

We optimize for cost and p95 latency as provided by Locust:
```
objectives:
- name: cost-gcp # Also "cost", "cost-aws", "cpu", ...
- name: p95-latency
  latency: p95
```

Generate the `experiment.yaml` file using
```
redskyctl generate experiment -f app.yaml > experiment.yaml
```
Generate the RBAC permission that allow the controller to patch the deployment:
```
redskyctl generate rbac -f experiment.yaml
```
Run the experiment
```
kubectl apply -f experiment.yaml
```
